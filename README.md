# <h1 align="center"> Apillon Simplet Blueprint Template üåê </h1>

## üìö Overview

This project is a template for creating new Tangle Blueprints using the Apillon Simplet framework. It provides a
starting point for creating new projects that can be deployed to the Tangle network. Apillon services and simplets are containerized services that can be deployed and hosted by Tangle operators, leveraging Apillon's SDK and suite of developer tooling for building web3 applications and infrastructures.

Check out [Apillon](https://apillon.io/) to learn more about the Apillon Simplet framework and how to build and deploy Tangle Blueprints.

## üìö Prerequisites

Before you can run this project, you will need to have the following software installed on your machine:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Forge](https://getfoundry.sh)
- [Tangle](https://github.com/tangle-network/tangle?tab=readme-ov-file#-getting-started-)

You will also need to install [cargo-tangle](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-tangle), our CLI tool for creating and
deploying Tangle Blueprints:

To install the Tangle CLI, run the following command:

> Supported on Linux, MacOS, and Windows (WSL2)

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/tangle-network/gadget/releases/download/cargo-tangle-v0.1.2/cargo-tangle-installer.sh | sh
```

Or, if you prefer to install the CLI from crates.io:

```bash
cargo install cargo-tangle --force # to get the latest version.
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

Once `cargo-tangle` is installed, you can create a new project with this template with the following command:

```sh
cargo tangle blueprint create --name <project-name> --repo <this-repo>
```

and follow the instructions to create a new project.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

Once you have created a new project, you can run the following command to start the project:

```sh
cargo build
```

to build the project, and

```sh
cargo tangle blueprint deploy
```

to deploy the blueprint to the Tangle network.
